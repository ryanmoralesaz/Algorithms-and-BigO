The famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss equation.

The formula to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 up to and including 
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$
 
is the formula derived by Gauss that gives the result directly without needing to sum the individual numbers.
The story goes that Gauss figured out this formula as a young schoolboy when his teacher asked the class to sum the numbers from 1 to 100, hoping for some peace while the class worked on the problem. Gauss, however, quickly realized that pairing each number from the start and end of the range (1 with 100, 2 with 99, etc.) each pair summed to 101, and there were 50 such pairs, giving the answer 5050 almost instantaneously.

This formula is a cornerstone example in arithmetic series and is often one of the first introductions to the concept of mathematical summation and series in algebra.
